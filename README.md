## Overview

This research aims to develop a generalized linear model to predict the outcome of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. The model aggregates polling data from various sources via the poll-of-polls method to provide a forecast of voter behavior regarding Kamala Harris, the Democratic Candidate, and Donald Trump, the Republican Candidate. This paper presents our exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clean and prepare the dataset followed by the predictive model and its results, which project a Kamala Harris win. The paper further presents an idolized survey to test these findings and discusses the methodology to run it using a USD $100K budget. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of Chat GPT 4.0 and Chat GPT 4.0 mini. The conversation history between the LLM chatbox can be found in other/llm.
