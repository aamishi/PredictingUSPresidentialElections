i want to simulate the data for predicting the US president for 2024 in R. I want the following variables: 
1. pollster_id,
2. pollster_name,
3. level - national or state level poll,
4. state - which US state,
5. leaning - party favour or swing state,
6. duration - duration of poll,
7. poll_quality - out of 5, lower the better,
8. predicted_part - which party is likeyl to win,
9. predicted_candidate - harris, biden, trump or hailey.

Here’s how you can simulate a sample dataset in R with the variables you need for predicting the 2024 U.S. presidential election. This code uses some randomization to generate plausible data for each column.

R
Copy code
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Set random seed for reproducibility
set.seed(2024)

# Define the number of polls to simulate
n <- 500

# Simulate poll data
poll_data <- tibble(
  pollster_id = sample(1:50, n, replace = TRUE),
  pollster_name = paste("Pollster", pollster_id),
  level = sample(c("national", "state"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7)),
  state = ifelse(level == "state", 
                 sample(state.name, n, replace = TRUE), 
                 NA_character_), # national level has no state
  leaning = sample(c("Democratic", "Republican", "Swing"), n, replace = TRUE),
  duration = sample(3:15, n, replace = TRUE), # duration of polls in days
  poll_quality = round(runif(n, 1, 5), 1), # poll quality rating from 1 to 5
  predicted_part = sample(c("Democratic", "Republican"), n, replace = TRUE),
  predicted_candidate = ifelse(predicted_part == "Democratic",
                               sample(c("Harris", "Biden"), n, replace = TRUE),
                               sample(c("Trump", "Hailey"), n, replace = TRUE))
)

# Print the first few rows of the simulated data
print(head(poll_data))
Explanation of Each Variable:
pollster_id: Random ID from 1 to 50.
pollster_name: Generic name based on pollster_id.
level: 30% chance for national polls and 70% for state polls.
state: If it's a state-level poll, assigns a random U.S. state name; otherwise, NA.
leaning: Party preference or swing state randomly assigned.
duration: Random duration in days between 3 and 15.
poll_quality: Random quality rating between 1 and 5 (lower is better).
predicted_part: Predicted party to win.
predicted_candidate: Candidate predicted to win, based on party.
This code generates a dataset of 500 entries with diverse poll data for analysis. Adjust the n value or probabilities as needed.

To ensure that the simulated data meets the intended structure and values, you can write tests for each variable using the testthat package in R. Here’s a sample test suite with at least two tests for each variable.

First, if you haven't already, install the testthat package:

R
Copy code
install.packages("testthat")
Then, create the tests in a script, for example test_poll_data.R:

R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(testthat)

# Define the simulated data-generating function
generate_poll_data <- function(n = 500) {
  tibble(
    pollster_id = sample(1:50, n, replace = TRUE),
    pollster_name = paste("Pollster", pollster_id),
    level = sample(c("national", "state"), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7)),
    state = ifelse(level == "state", 
                   sample(state.name, n, replace = TRUE), 
                   NA_character_),
    leaning = sample(c("Democratic", "Republican", "Swing"), n, replace = TRUE),
    duration = sample(3:15, n, replace = TRUE),
    poll_quality = round(runif(n, 1, 5), 1),
    predicted_part = sample(c("Democratic", "Republican"), n, replace = TRUE),
    predicted_candidate = ifelse(predicted_part == "Democratic",
                                 sample(c("Harris", "Biden"), n, replace = TRUE),
                                 sample(c("Trump", "Hailey"), n, replace = TRUE))
  )
}

# Generate test data
poll_data <- generate_poll_data()

# Begin tests
test_that("pollster_id is within the expected range and is integer", {
  expect_true(all(poll_data$pollster_id >= 1 & poll_data$pollster_id <= 50))
  expect_type(poll_data$pollster_id, "integer")
})

test_that("pollster_name corresponds to pollster_id", {
  expect_true(all(grepl("Pollster", poll_data$pollster_name)))
  expect_equal(poll_data$pollster_name, paste("Pollster", poll_data$pollster_id))
})

test_that("level is either national or state", {
  expect_true(all(poll_data$level %in% c("national", "state")))
  expect_equal(sum(poll_data$level == "national") / nrow(poll_data) >= 0.2, TRUE) # at least some are national
})

test_that("state is either a valid U.S. state name or NA for national level polls", {
  valid_states <- c(state.name, NA)
  expect_true(all(poll_data$state %in% valid_states))
  expect_true(all(is.na(poll_data$state[poll_data$level == "national"])))
})

test_that("leaning contains only expected values", {
  expect_true(all(poll_data$leaning %in% c("Democratic", "Republican", "Swing")))
  expect_equal(sum(poll_data$leaning == "Swing") > 0, TRUE) # some should be swing
})

test_that("duration is within the expected range", {
  expect_true(all(poll_data$duration >= 3 & poll_data$duration <= 15))
  expect_type(poll_data$duration, "integer")
})

test_that("poll_quality is between 1 and 5 and has numeric type", {
  expect_true(all(poll_data$poll_quality >= 1 & poll_data$poll_quality <= 5))
  expect_type(poll_data$poll_quality, "double")
})

test_that("predicted_part contains only Democratic or Republican", {
  expect_true(all(poll_data$predicted_part %in% c("Democratic", "Republican")))
  expect_equal(sum(poll_data$predicted_part == "Democratic") > 0, TRUE) # some are Democratic
  expect_equal(sum(poll_data$predicted_part == "Republican") > 0, TRUE) # some are Republican
})

test_that("predicted_candidate corresponds to the predicted_part", {
  dem_candidates <- c("Harris", "Biden")
  rep_candidates <- c("Trump", "Hailey")
  expect_true(all(poll_data$predicted_candidate[poll_data$predicted_part == "Democratic"] %in% dem_candidates))
  expect_true(all(poll_data$predicted_candidate[poll_data$predicted_part == "Republican"] %in% rep_candidates))
})
Explanation of Tests
pollster_id: Ensures all IDs are between 1 and 50 and are integer.
pollster_name: Checks names start with "Pollster" and match the pollster_id.
level: Confirms all values are either "national" or "state" and that at least some are "national".
state: Ensures states are valid U.S. names or NA for national-level polls.
leaning: Ensures values are "Democratic," "Republican," or "Swing" with some being swing.
duration: Ensures poll duration is between 3 and 15 days and integer.
poll_quality: Confirms poll quality is between 1 and 5 and numeric.
predicted_part: Checks for only "Democratic" or "Republican" values with both present.
predicted_candidate: Ensures predicted candidates match their corresponding predicted_part.
Run these tests in R using:

R
Copy code
testthat::test_file("test_poll_data.R")
This should provide a structured report on whether the data passes each test.
